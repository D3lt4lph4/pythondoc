# Python Documentation Project

This was taken from the Keras github and then modified a bit to make it more modular, they have a nice tool for auto-documentation generation but as far as I know they use it only for their project and it cannot be used on other project.

This is intended to be used with Mkdocs. 

## Building the documentation

(On going this have to be improved a lot)

- install MkDocs
- create the yml file for mkdocs
- run the autogen file
- run mkdocs serve
